# Powertool Standard Kit
This is the powertool standard kit. It is built in bun with typescript.

# Guide to building your own kit
## Prerequisites
I assume you're comfortable with the command line, understand javascript, and can use github. If you can't, you should learn those first.

You'll also need to be on a Unix based system such as Linux or Mac. If you're on windows I would recommend using WSL. Your milage with other tools such as Cygwin may vary.

To make a kit you'll need bun. Head over to [bun.sh](https://bun.sh). and install bun with the following command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
